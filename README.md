A Dashboard Manual & Documentation Google doc can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZVlQABecqyRsdmt4D1HqKXHbtRXrYuHigyq1Mi6wiWc/edit). The document teaches the use of the dashboard in terms of the Happraisal project, integration of the dashboard to different projects, 
and next steps for future dashboard features. The documentation section includes a short PsychoPy tutorial on key dashboard functionality, a quick dashboard overview, as well as a walkthrough of the Excel transformation Python script for future modification purposes.
